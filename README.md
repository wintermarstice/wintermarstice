- 🌱 I'm currently learning RUST.
- 🧵 I'm interested in machine learning, indie game development, and mathematical computing. Also have an eye on the frontend and backend development.
- 📚 I'm studying Physics.
- 🤔 I'm looking for help with structuring my code.
- 💬 Ask me about anything basically, provided that it is not too invasive.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started learning to code at age 7. No jokes, although it just was 5 lines of IntelliSense guided random keywords :D
